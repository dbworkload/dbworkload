# Next steps

This **Getting Started** used a workload meant to teach you how to code your own.

If you are just looking for a simple workload to kick the tires of your cluster,
you can try using an all-purpose workload such as the `kv` workload, see 
the docs [here](https://github.com/dbworkload/dbworkload/blob/main/workloads/postgres/kv.md).

The `kv.py` file is hosted in the same directory.
Copy it to your local directory and run any of the sample workload options described in its README.

## Final thoughts

For any question, start a [Discussion](https://github.com/dbworkload/dbworkload/discussions)
or, if you think you run into a bug or have a new feature you'd like to add, 
raise an [Issue](https://github.com/dbworkload/dbworkload/issues).

Best of luck with using `dbworkload`, and if you like the project, consider putting your GitHub star!
