# Plot the metrics

We finished last section collectiong the metrics of a test run into a CSV file.

In this section, we explore 2 convenient built-in functions.

## Terminal Charts

A quick and easy way to chart the metrics in the CSV file is to do so on
the terminal client using the [plot](../util/plot.md) utility.

Generally, you run `dbworkload` on a VM server which doesn't have a GUI, unlike the personal computer or MacBook
you're reading this documentation from.

On your Terminal client, run this command to chart the metrics

```bash
dbworkload util plot -i Bank.20241021_145825.csv
```

A screenshot renders the output best

## Interactive HTML charts

Another charting option is using the more sophisticated util function [`html`](../util/html.md).

```bash
$ dbworkload util html -i Bank.20241021_145825.csv 
2024-10-21 11:26:30,304 [INFO] (MainProcess MainThread) util:423: Saved merged CSV file to '/path/to/workloads/Bank.20241021_145825.html'
```

Now open the `.html` file in your browser

You can scroll over the chart with your mouse to highlight datapoints.
You can also zoom in to reveal more details.

Congratulation, you reached the end of the tutorial! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Hopefully you grasped the basics of what `dbworkload` is and how to use it.

Make sure you continue reading the other sections of these docs for more details about
`dbworkload`'s inner workings.
